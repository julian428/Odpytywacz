## Dashboard tutorial

1. Create a playlist by clicking the `create folder` icon.

   > every folders properties are stored in the `config.yaml` file.

   - The `title` property is **required** and its **maximum length** is **64** characters
   - The `description` property is **not required** and its **maximum length** is **1024** characters

2. To create an item press the `+ ITEM` button in the **top right** corner of the _config.yaml_ folder.

   > after changing any values in any file you have to press the `SAVE` button to save the file.

   - Every item folder in addition to the _config.yaml_ file has an `article.md` file where you can edit the items article

   > by pressing the `DELETE` button in the **config.yaml** file you will delete the folder with all it's children

   - The `color` property has to be a hexadecimal color value proceeded by a `#` sign.
   - You can enter the color value manually or press the `collor pallete` icon to choose a color.
   - The cover property has to be an `url` pointing to an image
   - You can **preview** the Items **final look** at the bottom of the _config.yaml_ file in real-time.
   - the **title** and **description** properties constraints remain **the same**.

3. You can add **questions** to the item by pressing the `+ QUESTION` button.

   - The type of the question can be `open` or `closed`.
     - **open** the user writes his answear as text.
     - **closed** the user can choose from a pool of answears.
   - The `answears` and `decoys` properties are lists separated by the `;` character.
     - **answears** are _compared_ to the users answear if the _type_ property is **open**
     - **answears** are _shown_ as options to choose if the _type_ is **closed**, the quantity shown is dependant on the **show-answears** property
     - **decoys** are only used if the _type_ is **closed** they are the other options to choose from.
   - The **show-options** property can be `2, 3, 4`
   - The **show-answears** property has to be always less than the _show-options_ value
   - The **question tab** content will be displayed to the user as the question.
